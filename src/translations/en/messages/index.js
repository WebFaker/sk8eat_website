  `Your goal is to get to your food on time. A timer is activated as soon as you start the game.
  If you manage to get your kebab before the timer runs out, you've won.
  But be careful, you also have a limited life system that can make you lose.
  Bonuses are available to go faster or to recover lives.`,

  ABOUT_TEXT_3:
  `Mechanisms have been added after much research : a life system that can be recovered or lost depending on the gameObject touched.
  A booster system that makes you move faster for a time.
  Obstacles that slow down our character's progress, etc.
  The UI has been worked on to display the number of lives, the can inventory and the countdown before the kebab is sold out.
  A main menu and a pause menu to exit the game have also been added.`,

  ABOUT_TEXT_4:
  `Sk8 game is a game inspired by the cartoon style which is very colorful with atypical characters.
  I was able to define the graphic charter after having created a moodboard.
  The design of the game and its story are similar to a rather childish universe that reminds us of old games.
  After determining the concept, the visual design of the game was created from scratch using a drawing software.
  The animations were created frame by frame, and then, converted into sprites.
  I wanted to create the totality of my visual assets so that the elements are coherent between each other.
  The animation and the sound are important elements because they bring life to it.
  All obstacles react to the playerâ€™s behavior. For example, the old woman gets angry when the player falls on her, or the cat jumps on the player when he gets close.`,
